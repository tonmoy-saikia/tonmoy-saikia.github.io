I'm Tonmoy Saikia, a computer vision and machine learning researcher at Torc Robotics. I completed my PhD in computer vision under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Brox, focusing on improving the robustness and efficiency of deep learning based computer vison models. During my PhD I also spent some time at Google in Cordelia Schmid's group. My research explores strategies including data augmentation, neural architecture search, and regularization techniques.

 I feel fortunate to have worked on a broad range of computer vision tasks, and I am always look for new challenging projects and ideas to work on. If you are interested in collaborations or discussing new ideas, feel free to contact me via email below.

When I am not working, you'll find me on the tennis court or in a bouldering hall :).
