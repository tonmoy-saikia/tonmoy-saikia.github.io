I am a graduate student at [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/). I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Previously, I worked as a software developer in India. I dabble in python, c++ and ruby.

In my free time, I like to play tennis, cook and go for bike rides. I also like to call myself an amateur photographer.

Here's a [link]({{site.['picfolio']}}) to some of my pictures.
